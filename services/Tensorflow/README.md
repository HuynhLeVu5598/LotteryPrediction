TensorFlow Tutorial for Time Series Prediction(AR、Anomaly Mixture AR、LSTM).


Feedforward neural networks applied to time series prediction are usually trained to predict the next time step x(t + 1) as a function of m previous values, x(t) := (x(t), x(t + 1),…, x(t − m + 1)), which, if a sum-of-squares error function is chosen, results in predicting the conditional mean 〈y|x(t)〉.
